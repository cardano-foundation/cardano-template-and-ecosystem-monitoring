# üí± Constant Product AMM Smart Contract

A decentralized automated market maker built on Cardano, implementing the constant product formula (x * y = k) to enable trustless token swaps and liquidity provision.

## üåü What is a Constant Product AMM?

Traditional cryptocurrency exchanges require order books and market makers to facilitate trading, creating several limitations:
- Centralized control over trading pairs and liquidity
- Dependence on active market makers for price discovery
- High barriers to entry for providing liquidity
- Potential for front-running and price manipulation
- Limited trading pairs and geographic restrictions

A constant product automated market maker (AMM) enables **decentralized trading** where users can swap tokens against liquidity pools following the mathematical formula x * y = k, ensuring continuous liquidity and fair price discovery without traditional market makers.

## üíé Key Benefits

### üîÑ **Automated Market Making**
- Algorithmic price discovery based on supply and demand
- Continuous liquidity availability for supported token pairs
- No need for traditional order books or centralized market makers
- Automatic arbitrage opportunities maintain price equilibrium

### üåê **Permissionless Liquidity**
- Anyone can provide liquidity and earn trading fees
- No minimum requirements or approval processes
- Proportional share of trading fees based on liquidity contribution
- Instant liquidity withdrawal capabilities

### üîç **Transparent Pricing**
- All pricing calculations are deterministic and verifiable
- Complete transparency of trading mechanics
- Real-time price impact calculations
- Historical trading data permanently recorded

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Decentralized & Trustless**
- No central authority controls the trading process
- Smart contracts automatically execute trades and distribute fees
- Immutable trading rules ensure fair treatment for all participants
- Censorship-resistant trading infrastructure

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Constant Product Formula Design

The AMM contract implements the proven constant product mechanism:
- ‚úÖ Maintains constant product (x * y = k) for price calculation
- ‚úÖ Automatic slippage calculation based on trade size
- ‚úÖ Proportional fee distribution to liquidity providers
- ‚úÖ Protection against infinite loss and sandwich attacks
- ‚ùå No price manipulation or unfair trading advantages

This design ensures that trading remains fair and sustainable while providing continuous liquidity for token pairs.

## üîÑ Contract Workflow

### Step 1: Liquidity Pool Creation
The contract enables:
- Creation of new trading pairs between two tokens
- Initial liquidity provision sets the starting exchange rate
- Minting of liquidity tokens representing pool ownership share
- Establishment of trading fee structure

### Step 2: Liquidity Provision
For adding liquidity:
- Users deposit equal value amounts of both tokens
- Pool calculates optimal ratio based on current reserves
- Liquidity tokens are minted proportional to contribution
- Immediate participation in trading fee collection

### Step 3: Token Swapping
During trading:
- Users specify input token, amount, and minimum output
- AMM calculates output using constant product formula
- Trading fees are deducted and added to pool reserves
- Price impact is determined by trade size relative to liquidity

### Step 4: Liquidity Removal
For withdrawing liquidity:
- Users burn their liquidity tokens to reclaim underlying assets
- Proportional share of both tokens returned to liquidity provider
- Includes accumulated trading fees from all transactions
- Pool reserves are updated to reflect withdrawal

## üìã Contract Specification

### Parameters (defined at deployment):
- **token_a**: first token in the trading pair
- **token_b**: second token in the trading pair
- **trading_fee**: percentage fee charged on each swap (typically 0.3%)

### Actions:
- **create_pool**: establish new liquidity pool for token pair
- **add_liquidity**: deposit tokens to pool and receive liquidity tokens
- **swap_tokens**: exchange one token for another using constant product formula
- **remove_liquidity**: burn liquidity tokens and withdraw proportional reserves
- **collect_fees**: claim accumulated trading fees (for liquidity providers)

### Required Functionalities:
- Native token handling and transfers
- Arbitrary precision arithmetic for price calculations
- Slippage protection and minimum output guarantees
- Liquidity token minting and burning
- Fee collection and distribution mechanisms

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach with Cardano

### Choosing Your Development Stack

For guidance on selecting the right tools and technologies for your Cardano development needs, consult the **[Cardano Tool Compass](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-tool-compass)** - a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the Cardano development ecosystem and choose the tools that best fit your project requirements and technical preferences.

### Smart Contract Development
Choose your preferred Cardano smart contract language and framework:
- **Aiken**: Functional programming approach with precise arithmetic for AMM calculations
- **Plutus (Haskell)**: Native Cardano smart contract language with advanced mathematical operations
- **OpShin (Python)**: Python-based smart contract development with DeFi libraries
- **Helios**: TypeScript-like syntax for Cardano contracts with AMM support

### Off-chain Development
Select appropriate off-chain tools based on your tech stack:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Lucid Evolution for DEX interactions, Mesh.js for AMM management
- **Java**: Cardano Client Library (CCL) with DeFi protocol support
- **Python**: PyCardano with AMM calculation libraries
- **Haskell**: Plutus Application Framework with native DeFi capabilities

### Development Process
1. **Design Phase**: Define AMM mechanics, fee structures, and liquidity management
2. **Implementation**: Build smart contracts with precise mathematical operations
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test trading scenarios and edge cases on testnets
4. **Integration**: Develop off-chain components for user interface and arbitrage
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to Cardano mainnet after comprehensive financial testing

### Cardano-Specific Considerations
- **Native Tokens**: Leverage Cardano's native token capabilities for all trading pairs
- **UTXO Model**: Design efficient AMM operations using UTXO parallelization
- **Precision Arithmetic**: Handle token decimals and price calculations accurately
- **MEV Protection**: Implement safeguards against maximal extractable value attacks
- **Batching**: Enable efficient batch swaps and liquidity operations
