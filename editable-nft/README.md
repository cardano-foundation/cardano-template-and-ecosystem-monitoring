# 🎨 Editable NFT Smart Contract

A dynamic non-fungible token system built on Cardano, enabling token data modification with ownership transfer and permanent sealing capabilities.

## 🌟 What is an Editable NFT?

Traditional NFTs are immutable once minted, creating limitations for evolving digital assets:
- Static metadata cannot be updated after minting
- No mechanism for content corrections or improvements
- Limited utility for gaming assets that change over time
- Inability to lock token data permanently when needed
- No controlled transfer mechanism with editing rights

Editable NFTs provide **controlled mutability** where token owners can modify data content and transfer ownership, with the ability to permanently seal the token to prevent future modifications.

## 💎 Key Benefits

### 🔄 **Dynamic Content Updates**
- Token data can be modified by current owner
- Support for evolving digital assets and metadata
- Ability to enhance or correct token information
- Flexible data structure for arbitrary content

### 🌐 **Ownership Transfer Control**
- Clear ownership transfer mechanism between parties
- New owners inherit editing capabilities
- Seamless transition of token control rights
- Maintained token identity through transfers

### 🔍 **Permanent Sealing Mechanism**
- Token data can be permanently locked by owner
- Sealed tokens prevent any future modifications
- Irreversible commitment to final token state
- Enhanced trust through immutability option

### ⚖️ **Flexible Token Lifecycle**
- Edit phase for content development and refinement
- Transfer phase for ownership changes
- Seal phase for permanent finalization
- Clear state transitions with defined capabilities

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Ownership-Based Editing Design

The editable NFT contract implements simple ownership controls:
- ✅ Current owner can modify token data
- ✅ Current owner can transfer token to new owner
- ✅ Any owner can permanently seal token data
- ✅ Sealed tokens prevent all future modifications
- ❌ No editing capabilities for non-owners or sealed tokens

This design ensures clear ownership rights while providing flexible content management and permanent sealing options.

## 🔄 Contract Workflow

### Step 1: Token Purchase/Minting (Owner1)
The initial owner:
- Mints or acquires a new editable NFT with unique ID
- Receives full ownership and editing rights
- Token is created with initial data content
- Token starts in unsealed, editable state

### Step 2: Content Editing (Owner1)
During ownership period:
- Owner1 can modify the token's data field
- Updates are only possible while token remains unsealed
- Multiple edits can be performed by the same owner
- Content changes are permanently recorded

### Step 3: Ownership Transfer (Owner1 → Owner2)
Transfer process:
- Owner1 transfers token ownership to Owner2
- Ownership rights fully transfer to new owner
- Owner2 gains complete control over token
- Previous owner loses all editing capabilities

### Step 4: Token Sealing (Owner2)
Final state transition:
- Owner2 permanently seals the token data
- Sealed state prevents any future modifications
- Token data becomes permanently immutable
- No further edits possible by any party

## 📋 Contract Specification

### Parameters (defined at deployment):
- **token_id**: unique identifier for each NFT
- **owner**: current owner address with editing rights
- **data**: arbitrary-length data field for token content
- **sealed**: boolean flag indicating if token is permanently locked

### Actions:
- **buy_token**: mint new editable NFT with initial data
- **edit_token**: modify token data (only if unsealed and owner)
- **transfer_token**: change token ownership to new address
- **seal_token**: permanently lock token data (irreversible)

### Required Functionalities:
- Custom token creation and management
- Dynamic data storage for arbitrary content
- Ownership tracking and transfer mechanisms
- Transaction revert for unauthorized operations
- Boolean state management for seal flag

## 🛠️ Development Approach with Cardano

### Choosing Your Development Stack

For guidance on selecting the right tools and technologies for your Cardano development needs, consult the **[Cardano Tool Compass](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-tool-compass)** - a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the Cardano development ecosystem and choose the tools that best fit your project requirements and technical preferences.

### Smart Contract Development
Choose your preferred Cardano smart contract language and framework:
- **Aiken**: Functional programming approach with strong type safety for NFT logic
- **Plutus (Haskell)**: Native Cardano smart contract language with advanced token features
- **OpShin (Python)**: Python-based smart contract development with NFT libraries
- **Helios**: TypeScript-like syntax for Cardano contracts with metadata handling

### Off-chain Development
Select appropriate off-chain tools based on your tech stack:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Lucid Evolution for NFT interactions, Mesh.js for metadata management
- **Java**: Cardano Client Library (CCL) with NFT support
- **Python**: PyCardano with metadata handling capabilities
- **Haskell**: Plutus Application Framework with native token support

### Development Process
1. **Design Phase**: Define editable fields, permission systems, and update mechanisms
2. **Implementation**: Build smart contracts with metadata versioning and access controls
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test editing scenarios and permission enforcement on testnets
4. **Integration**: Develop off-chain components for metadata management and UI
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to Cardano mainnet after comprehensive testing

### Cardano-Specific Considerations
- **Native Tokens**: Leverage Cardano's native token capabilities for NFT minting
- **Metadata Standards**: Follow CIP-25 and other Cardano NFT metadata standards
- **UTXO Model**: Design efficient UTXO handling for NFT updates and transfers
- **Transaction Metadata**: Store version history efficiently in transaction metadata
- **Asset Policies**: Implement proper minting policies with time locks and multi-signature
