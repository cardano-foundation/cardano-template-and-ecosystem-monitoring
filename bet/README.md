# 🎲 Blockchain Betting Smart Contract

A decentralized two-player betting system built on Cardano using Aiken, demonstrating the power of trustless wagering with oracle-based resolution.

## 🌟 What is a Blockchain Bet?

Traditional online betting requires trusting a centralized platform to:
- Hold your funds securely
- Execute payouts fairly
- Not manipulate outcomes
- Remain solvent and operational

A blockchain-based bet eliminates these trust requirements through **smart contracts** - a validation layer that automatically enforces the rules without any possibility of manipulation, censorship, or downtime.

## 💎 Key Benefits

### 🔒 **Trustless Execution**
- Funds are locked in the smart contract, not controlled by any party
- Payout logic is transparent and immutable
- No possibility of the "house" running away with your money

### 🌐 **Decentralized & Censorship-Resistant**
- No central authority can block, freeze, or confiscate funds
- Operates 24/7 without maintenance windows or geographic restrictions
- Participants interact directly with the blockchain

### 🔍 **Complete Transparency**
- All bet terms are visible on-chain before participation
- Contract logic is open-source and verifiable
- Transaction history is permanently recorded and auditable

### ⚖️ **Fair & Impartial Resolution**
- Oracle has a strictly limited role: only announcing the winner
- Oracle cannot access funds or change bet terms
- Only the winner is able to receive funds when oracle announces result

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Oracle Design

The oracle in this system has intentionally restricted capabilities:
- ✅ Can announce the winner after bet expiration
- ❌ Cannot access or redirect funds
- ❌ Cannot modify bet terms or participants
- ❌ Cannot act before the bet expiration time

This design ensures the oracle serves purely as a trusted information provider, not a funds custodian.

## 🔄 Contract Workflow

### Step 1: Bet Initialization
The contract verifies:
- Player 1 has signed the transaction
- Initial bet amount is locked in the contract
- Oracle is designated and different from Player 1
- Expiration time is set for the future
- Bet token is minted to track this specific bet

### Step 2: Player 2 Joins
The contract ensures:
- The bet hasn't expired yet
- Player 2 is different from Player 1 and the oracle
- Player 2 matches Player 1's bet amount exactly
- Total pot is now locked in the contract
- Bet datum is updated to include Player 2

### Step 3: Oracle Resolution
After expiration, the contract validates:
- The oracle is authorized to announce results
- The announced winner is one of the two players
- Both players had joined (bet was active)
- Entire pot is sent to the winner's address

### Step 4: Automatic Payout
- No additional action needed from the winner
- No fees beyond standard transaction costs
- Completely non-custodial throughout

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions) - Smart contract development framework
- [Deno](https://deno.land/) - For off-chain code execution
- Cardano wallet with test ADA (for testnet deployment)

### Building the Contract

```bash
# Navigate to the contract directory
cd onchain/aiken

# Validate contract logic
aiken check

# Build the contract
aiken build
```
