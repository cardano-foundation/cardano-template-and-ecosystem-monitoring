# üëõ Blockchain Simple Wallet Smart Contract

A decentralized wallet system built on Cardano that allows owners to deposit, manage, and execute transactions through smart contract logic with enhanced security and programmable features.

## üåü What is a Blockchain Simple Wallet?

Traditional digital wallets require trusting:
- Wallet software providers to secure private keys
- Third-party services for transaction processing
- Centralized platforms for account management
- External validators for transaction authenticity

A blockchain-based simple wallet eliminates these dependencies through **smart contracts**, providing a programmable wallet that operates entirely on-chain with transparent transaction logic and immutable security guarantees.

## üíé Key Benefits

### üîí **Enhanced Security**
- Smart contract logic prevents unauthorized access
- All transactions require owner authorization
- Transparent execution prevents hidden operations
- Immutable contract code ensures consistent behavior

### üåê **Decentralized & Self-Sovereign**
- No reliance on external wallet providers
- Complete control over funds and transaction logic
- Operates independently of third-party services
- Censorship-resistant transaction execution

### üîç **Complete Transparency**
- All wallet operations are visible on-chain
- Transaction history is permanently recorded
- Contract logic is open-source and verifiable
- Balance and operations are publicly auditable

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Programmable Logic**
- Custom transaction validation rules
- Batch transaction capabilities
- Automated transaction scheduling
- Integration with other smart contracts

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Wallet Design

The simple wallet implements core wallet functionality through smart contracts:
- **Owner-Only Access**: All operations restricted to authorized wallet owner
- **Transaction Queue**: Create and execute transactions programmatically
- **Balance Management**: Secure deposit and withdrawal mechanisms
- **Data Handling**: Support for transaction metadata and custom data fields

## üîÑ Contract Workflow

### Step 1: Wallet Initialization
The wallet owner sets up:
- Deploys wallet contract with owner authorization
- Defines authorized address for wallet operations
- Establishes initial wallet parameters

### Step 2: Deposit Operations
Owner can fund the wallet:
- Deposit any amount of native cryptocurrency
- Multiple deposits accumulate in wallet balance
- All deposits are tracked and recorded on-chain

### Step 3: Transaction Creation
Owner creates pending transactions:
- Specify recipient address for transaction
- Define transaction value and data payload
- Transaction is recorded with unique ID but not yet executed

### Step 4: Transaction Execution
Owner executes pending transactions:
- Reference transaction by unique ID
- Validate sufficient wallet balance
- Transfer funds to specified recipient
- Mark transaction as completed

### Step 5: Balance Management
Owner can withdraw funds:
- Withdraw entire wallet balance (subject to platform constraints)
- Maintain minimum balance requirements where applicable
- Preserve wallet contract continuity

## üìã Contract Specification

### Parameters (defined at deployment):
- **owner**: authorized address that can operate the wallet
- **authorized_address**: specific address with wallet permissions

### Actions:
- **deposit**: owner adds funds to wallet balance
- **createTransaction**: owner creates pending transaction with recipient, value, and data
- **executeTransaction**: owner executes pending transaction by ID
- **withdraw**: owner withdraws wallet balance

### Required Functionalities:
- Native token handling
- Transaction revert capabilities
- Dynamic transaction storage
- Owner authentication mechanisms

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach with Cardano

### Choosing Your Development Stack

For guidance on selecting the right tools and technologies for your Cardano development needs, consult the **[Cardano Tool Compass](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-tool-compass)** - a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the Cardano development ecosystem and choose the tools that best fit your project requirements and technical preferences.

### Smart Contract Development
Choose your preferred Cardano smart contract language and framework:
- **Aiken**: Functional programming with strong owner authentication patterns
- **Plutus (Haskell)**: Native Cardano smart contract language with advanced type safety
- **OpShin (Python)**: Python-based development with intuitive wallet logic
- **Helios**: TypeScript-like syntax for accessible wallet development

### Off-chain Development
Select appropriate off-chain tools for wallet interaction:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Lucid Evolution, Mesh.js for seamless wallet integration
- **Java**: Cardano Client Library (CCL) for enterprise wallet applications
- **Python**: PyCardano with comprehensive wallet management features
- **Haskell**: Plutus Application Framework for advanced wallet logic

### Development Process
1. **Security Design**: Implement robust owner authentication and authorization
2. **Transaction Logic**: Build secure transaction creation and execution mechanisms
3. **Balance Management**: Ensure accurate tracking and withdrawal capabilities
4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all wallet operations and edge cases
5. **Security Audit**: Verify wallet security against common attack vectors

### Cardano-Specific Considerations
- **UTXO Management**: Design efficient UTXO handling for wallet operations
- **Covenant Preservation**: Maintain contract continuity through transaction cycles
- **Minimum ADA Requirements**: Handle Cardano's minimum ADA constraints
- **Transaction Fees**: Account for network fees in withdrawal calculations
- **Script References**: Optimize transaction costs through script reference patterns
