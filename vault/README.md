# 🔐 Blockchain Vault Smart Contract

A decentralized security vault built on Cardano that implements time-delayed withdrawals and recovery mechanisms to protect funds against private key theft and unauthorized access.

## 🌟 What is a Blockchain Vault?

Traditional cryptocurrency storage faces critical security challenges:
- Immediate loss of all funds if private keys are compromised
- No recovery mechanism for stolen or hacked wallets
- Lack of time-based security controls for large transactions
- Inability to prevent unauthorized access even with strong security

A blockchain-based vault eliminates these vulnerabilities through **smart contracts** that implement time-locked withdrawals and recovery key mechanisms, providing multiple layers of security that protect against theft while maintaining user control.

## 💎 Key Benefits

### 🔒 **Enhanced Security Architecture**
- Time-delayed withdrawals prevent immediate fund theft
- Recovery key system allows emergency intervention
- Multiple authorization layers for fund *access
- Protection against single point of failure attacks

### 🌐 **Decentralized Security**
- No reliance on external security services or custodians
- Smart contract logic prevents unauthorized override
- Transparent security mechanisms visible on-chain
- Immutable security rules that cannot be bypassed

### 🔍 **Transparent Operations**
- All vault operations are publicly verifiable
- Withdrawal requests and timings are visible on-chain
- Recovery actions are permanently recorded
- Complete audit trail of all security events

### ⚖️ **User-Controlled Recovery**
- Owner maintains control over recovery mechanisms
- Flexible wait times based on security needs
- Emergency cancellation capabilities
- No third-party intervention required

## ⛓ On-chain

### Aiken

#### 🔌 Prerequisites

- [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions#from-aikup-linux--macos-only)

#### 🪄 Test and build

```zsh
cd onchain/aiken
aiken check
aiken build
```

## 📄 Off-chain

### Java Cardano Client Lib 
This offchain code is written by using the [Cardano Client Lib](https://github.com/bloxbean/cardano-client-lib).
It assumes that the addresses are topped up. If you need some tAda, you can get some from the [Cardano Testnets Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet/).

To simplify execution, all the code is contained in a single file, which can be run using `jbang`.

#### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following tools installed:

##### 1. Install JBang
You can install JBang using various methods:

- Using **SDKMAN**:
    ```shell
    sdk install jbang
    ```

- Using **cURL**:
    ```shell
    curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup
    ```

For other installation methods, refer to the [JBang installation guide](https://www.jbang.dev/download/).

**Note:** If Java is not installed on your machine, JBang will download a Java runtime for you.

##### 2. Install and Start Yaci DevKit
You need to download and start the Yaci DevKit. This can be done using either the Docker version or the NPM distribution.

###### a. Docker Version:
Follow the instructions [here](https://devkit.yaci.xyz/yaci_cli_distribution).

After installing Yaci Devkit Docker distribution, you can start DevKit in non-interactive mode in just one command:

```shell
devkit start create-node -o --start
```

###### b. NPM Distribution:
Follow the instructions [here](https://devkit.yaci.xyz/yaci_cli_npm_distr).

**Important:**  
When starting the Yaci DevKit using NPM distribution, be sure to include the `--enable-yaci-store` option with the `up` command.

#### Running the Code

To run the code, use the following command:

```shell
cd offchain
jbang Vault.java
```

## Verify the Output

After running the code, you can verify the output in Yaci Viewer. To access Yaci Viewer in docker distribution, use the following url

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Multi-Layer Security Design

The vault implements sophisticated security mechanisms:
- **Time-Lock Protection**: Mandatory waiting period between withdrawal request and execution
- **Recovery Key System**: Separate key for emergency cancellation of withdrawals
- **Request-Finalize Pattern**: Two-step withdrawal process prevents immediate access
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable wait times based on security requirements

## 🔄 Contract Workflow

### Step 1: Vault Creation
The vault owner establishes:
- Designates recovery key (separate from owner key)
- Sets wait time duration for withdrawal delays
- Deploys vault contract with security parameters

### Step 2: Fund Deposits
Anyone can deposit to vault:
- Deposits are accepted from any address
- Funds are immediately secured under vault protection
- No withdrawal possible without proper authorization sequence

### Step 3: Withdrawal Request
Owner initiates withdrawal:
- Specifies recipient address and withdrawal amount
- Request is recorded with timestamp
- Withdrawal cannot be completed immediately

### Step 4: Wait Period
Security delay is enforced:
- Wait time must elapse before withdrawal can be finalized
- Recovery key holder can cancel request during this period
- Request remains pending until either finalized or cancelled

### Step 5: Withdrawal Finalization
After wait period:
- Owner can finalize withdrawal if wait time has passed
- Funds are transferred to specified recipient
- Vault remains active for future operations

### Step 6: Emergency Cancellation
Recovery key capabilities:
- Recovery key holder can cancel pending withdrawals
- Cancellation prevents unauthorized fund access
- Provides emergency intervention capability

## 📋 Contract Specification

### Parameters (defined at deployment):
- **owner**: primary key that can initiate withdrawals
- **recovery_key**: emergency key that can cancel withdrawal requests
- **wait_time**: mandatory delay between withdrawal request and finalization

### Actions:
- **withdraw**: owner requests withdrawal specifying recipient and amount
- **finalize**: owner completes withdrawal after wait time expires
- **cancel**: recovery key holder cancels pending withdrawal requests

### Required Functionalities:
- Native token handling
- Time constraint enforcement
- Transaction revert capabilities
- Multi-key authorization system

## 🛠️ Development Approach with Cardano
