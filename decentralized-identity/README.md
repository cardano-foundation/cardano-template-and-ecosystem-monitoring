# üÜî Decentralized Identity Smart Contract

A blockchain-based identity management system built on Cardano, implementing self-sovereign identity with identity addresses, ownership control, and delegate management based on EIP 1056.

## üåü What is Decentralized Identity?

Traditional identity systems rely on centralized authorities and intermediaries for identity verification:
- Identity verification depends on trusted third parties
- Users have limited control over their identity data
- Identity management is fragmented across multiple platforms
- No standardized way to prove identity across different systems
- Centralized points of failure compromise identity security

Decentralized identity enables **self-sovereign identity** where blockchain addresses serve as identities, users control ownership through cryptographic signatures, and delegates can be authorized for specific time periods without compromising core identity control.

## üíé Key Benefits

### üîí **Self-Sovereign Control**
- Blockchain addresses serve as unique identities
- Cryptographic signatures prove ownership and authorization
- No reliance on centralized identity providers
- Direct control over identity management decisions

### üåê **Delegate Management**
- Temporary delegates can be authorized for specific privileges
- Time-limited delegate permissions with automatic expiration
- Flexible delegation without compromising core ownership
- Block-based validity periods for precise control

### üîç **Ownership Transfer**
- Identity ownership can be transferred through signed transactions
- Cryptographic proof of ownership changes
- Secure handover of identity control to new owners
- Maintained identity continuity across ownership changes

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Decentralized Verification**
- Message hashing and signature verification for authentication
- No central authority required for identity validation
- Transparent and verifiable identity operations
- Blockchain-based audit trail for all identity actions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Address-Based Identity Design

The decentralized identity contract implements EIP 1056-based identity management:
- ‚úÖ Blockchain addresses as identity identifiers
- ‚úÖ Ownership control through cryptographic signatures
- ‚úÖ Delegate authorization with time-limited validity
- ‚úÖ Message verification for secure operations
- ‚ùå No centralized identity storage or control

This design ensures that identity management remains decentralized while providing flexible delegation and ownership transfer capabilities.

## üîÑ Contract Workflow

### Step 1: Identity Generation
The contract enables:
- Any blockchain address automatically serves as an identity
- No explicit registration required for basic identity creation
- Address owner has full control over identity management
- Identity exists as long as address exists on blockchain

### Step 2: Ownership Management
For identity control:
- Current owner can transfer ownership to new address
- Ownership changes require cryptographically signed transactions
- New owner gains full control over identity management
- Previous owner loses all privileges upon transfer

### Step 3: Delegate Authorization
Delegation features include:
- Owner can create delegates with specific privileges
- Delegates are valid for specified number of blocks
- Different delegates can have different authorization levels
- Automatic expiration prevents stale delegate permissions

### Step 4: Verification Operations
Identity verification through:
- Message hashing for creating verifiable challenges
- Signature verification for proving authorization
- Delegate validation against current block height
- Ownership verification through cryptographic proofs

## üìã Contract Specification

### Parameters (defined per identity):
- **identity**: blockchain address serving as identity identifier
- **owner**: current owner address with full control privileges
- **delegates**: mapping of delegate addresses to their validity periods and privileges

### Actions:
- **changeOwner**: transfer identity ownership to new address (requires owner signature)
- **addDelegate**: authorize delegate with specific privileges for set number of blocks
- **removeDelegate**: revoke delegate authorization before expiration
- **validDelegate**: check if delegate has valid authorization for current block

### Required Functionalities:
- Message hashing for creating verifiable content
- Message signature verification for authentication
- Block height tracking for time-based delegate validity
- Transaction revert mechanism for unauthorized operations
- Dynamic data structures for delegate management

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach with Cardano

### Choosing Your Development Stack

For guidance on selecting the right tools and technologies for your Cardano development needs, consult the **[Cardano Tool Compass](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-tool-compass)** - a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the Cardano development ecosystem and choose the tools that best fit your project requirements and technical preferences.

### Smart Contract Development
Choose your preferred Cardano smart contract language and framework:
- **Aiken**: Functional programming approach with strong cryptographic capabilities
- **Plutus (Haskell)**: Native Cardano smart contract language with advanced identity features
- **OpShin (Python)**: Python-based smart contract development with identity libraries
- **Helios**: TypeScript-like syntax for Cardano contracts with DID support

### Off-chain Development
Select appropriate off-chain tools based on your tech stack:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Lucid Evolution with DID libraries, Mesh.js for identity management
- **Java**: Cardano Client Library (CCL) with cryptographic identity support
- **Python**: PyCardano with verifiable credential libraries
- **Haskell**: Plutus Application Framework with native identity capabilities

### Development Process
1. **Design Phase**: Define DID methods, credential schemas, and verification protocols
2. **Implementation**: Build smart contracts with cryptographic identity verification
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test identity scenarios and privacy preservation on testnets
4. **Integration**: Develop off-chain components for user identity management
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to Cardano mainnet after comprehensive security auditing

### Cardano-Specific Considerations
- **Native Tokens**: Use Cardano native tokens for identity credentials and badges
- **Metadata Standards**: Follow emerging DID and verifiable credential standards
- **UTXO Model**: Design efficient identity operations using UTXO parallelization
- **Privacy Features**: Implement zero-knowledge proofs within Cardano script constraints
- **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility with other blockchain identity systems
