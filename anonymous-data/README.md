# 🔒 Anonymous Data Smart Contract

A cryptographic data storage system built on Cardano, enabling users to store and retrieve on-chain data using hash-based anonymous identifiers without revealing their identity.

## 🌟 What is Anonymous Data Storage?

Traditional on-chain data storage systems link data directly to user addresses, creating privacy concerns:
- All stored data can be traced back to specific wallet addresses
- Public blockchain records expose user activity patterns
- No way to store data without revealing identity
- Limited privacy for sensitive information storage
- Permanent association between users and their data

Anonymous data smart contracts enable **hash-based data storage** where users can store and retrieve data using cryptographic identifiers generated from their address and a secret nonce, providing privacy while maintaining data integrity.

## 💎 Key Benefits

### 🔒 **Identity Protection**
- Data storage without revealing wallet addresses
- Cryptographic hash-based access control
- No direct link between stored data and user identity

### 🌐 **Flexible Access Control**
- Users can generate multiple anonymous identifiers
- Different nonces create separate data storage compartments
- Selective disclosure of specific data sets

### 🔍 **Cryptographic Security**
- Hash-based verification ensures data integrity
- Only users with correct nonce can retrieve their data
- Tamper-proof storage with cryptographic guarantees

### ⚖️ **Decentralized Storage**
- No central authority controls data access
- Permanent on-chain storage with blockchain security
- Global accessibility without geographic restrictions

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Hash-Based Identification

The anonymous data contract implements simple cryptographic storage:
- ✅ Hash generation combining user address and secret nonce
- ✅ Data storage associated with cryptographic identifiers
- ✅ Retrieval mechanism using original nonce for verification
- ✅ Multiple storage compartments per user with different nonces
- ❌ No direct address-to-data linking visible on-chain

This design ensures that data can be stored and retrieved privately while maintaining cryptographic integrity.

## 🔄 Contract Workflow

### Step 1: ID Generation
The contract enables:
- User generates cryptographic hash using their address and chosen nonce
- Hash serves as anonymous identifier for data storage
- Same address can create multiple IDs with different nonces
- No revelation of actual address or nonce during generation

### Step 2: Data Storage
During storage phase:
- User associates binary data with their generated hash ID
- Data is stored on-chain linked to the cryptographic identifier
- Storage operation doesn't reveal user's actual address
- Multiple data entries can be stored with different IDs

### Step 3: Data Retrieval
For accessing stored data:
- User provides original nonce used for ID generation
- Contract regenerates hash using caller's address and provided nonce
- If hash matches existing storage ID, data is returned
- Only the original user can retrieve their data

## 📋 Contract Specification
