# üè≠ Factory Smart Contract

A contract creation system built on Cardano, enabling users to deploy Product contracts with custom tags and maintain a registry of created instances.

## üåü What is a Smart Contract Factory?

Traditional smart contract deployment requires individual manual deployment and tracking of each contract instance:
- No centralized registry of deployed contract instances
- Difficulty tracking which contracts belong to which users
- Manual deployment process for each new contract
- No standardized way to create similar contract types
- Complex coordination between factory and created contracts

A smart contract factory provides **programmatic contract creation** where users can deploy new Product contracts with custom parameters and maintain a registry of all created instances for easy management and discovery.

## üíé Key Benefits

### üîÑ **Automated Contract Creation**
- Programmatic deployment of Product contracts
- Custom tag assignment for each created contract
- Standardized creation process for consistency
- User-specific contract instance tracking

### üåê **Centralized Registry**
- Factory maintains list of all created Product contracts
- Easy discovery of contracts created by specific users
- Organized tracking of contract instances
- Simplified contract management and monitoring

### üîç **Bidirectional Linking**
- Product contracts know their factory origin
- Factory tracks all created Product instances
- Clear relationship between factory and products
- Enhanced traceability and verification

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Simplified Management**
- Single factory interface for contract creation
- Batch querying of user's Product contracts
- Standardized Product contract interface
- Reduced deployment complexity for users

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Factory-Product Pattern Design

The factory contract implements simple contract creation mechanics:
- ‚úÖ Factory creates Product contracts with user-specified tags
- ‚úÖ Each Product contract stores its tag and factory reference
- ‚úÖ Factory maintains registry of created contracts per user
- ‚úÖ Product contracts provide access to stored tag information
- ‚ùå No unauthorized contract creation or registry manipulation

This design ensures clear relationships between factory and created contracts while providing simple management capabilities.

## üîÑ Contract Workflow

### Step 1: Product Creation
The factory enables:
- User calls factory to create new Product contract
- User specifies a tag string to be stored in Product
- Factory deploys new Product contract with specified tag
- Product contract stores tag and factory address reference

### Step 2: Registry Management
During creation process:
- Factory automatically adds new Product address to user's registry
- User's contract list is updated with new Product instance
- Bidirectional linking established between factory and product
- Registry maintains complete history of user's created contracts

### Step 3: Product Access
For accessing Product data:
- Users can query Product contracts directly for tag information
- Only original creator can access tag data from Product contract
- Product contract provides factory address for verification
- Tag retrieval limited to authorized users only

### Step 4: Contract Discovery
Registry features include:
- Users can query factory for list of their created Products
- Factory returns addresses of all user's Product contracts
- Easy discovery and management of multiple Product instances
- Complete tracking of contract creation history

## üìã Contract Specification

### Factory Contract Parameters:
- **user_products**: mapping of user addresses to their created Product contract addresses

### Factory Contract Actions:
- **createProduct**: deploy new Product contract with user-specified tag
- **getProducts**: return list of Product contract addresses created by user

### Product Contract Parameters:
- **tag**: string value specified during Product creation
- **factory**: address of Factory contract that created this Product
- **creator**: address of user who created this Product

### Product Contract Actions:
- **getTag**: retrieve tag string (only accessible by original creator)
- **getFactory**: return address of factory that created this Product

### Required Functionalities:
- In-contract deployment capabilities for creating new contracts
- Key-value mapping for user-to-contracts registry
- Dynamic array handling for contract address lists
- Transaction revert mechanism for unauthorized access
- String storage and retrieval for tag data

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach with Cardano

### Choosing Your Development Stack

For guidance on selecting the right tools and technologies for your Cardano development needs, consult the **[Cardano Tool Compass](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-tool-compass)** - a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the Cardano development ecosystem and choose the tools that best fit your project requirements and technical preferences.

### Smart Contract Development
Choose your preferred Cardano smart contract language and framework:
- **Aiken**: Functional programming approach with strong template validation capabilities
- **Plutus (Haskell)**: Native Cardano smart contract language with advanced deployment features
- **OpShin (Python)**: Python-based smart contract development with factory patterns
- **Helios**: TypeScript-like syntax for Cardano contracts with template management

### Off-chain Development
Select appropriate off-chain tools based on your tech stack:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Lucid Evolution for contract deployment automation, Mesh.js for instance management
- **Java**: Cardano Client Library (CCL) with factory deployment support
- **Python**: PyCardano with template and instance management capabilities
- **Haskell**: Plutus Application Framework with native deployment automation

### Development Process
1. **Design Phase**: Define template structures, parameter schemas, and deployment automation
2. **Implementation**: Build smart contracts with template validation and instance creation
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test deployment scenarios and template variations on testnets
4. **Integration**: Develop off-chain components for factory management and monitoring
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to Cardano mainnet after comprehensive template validation

### Cardano-Specific Considerations
- **UTXO Model**: Design efficient factory operations using UTXO parallelization
- **Script References**: Utilize Cardano's script reference features for template reuse
- **Transaction Size**: Optimize deployment transactions for Cardano's size limits
- **Native Tokens**: Use native tokens for factory access control and instance identification
- **Babbage Features**: Leverage inline datums and reference scripts for efficiency
